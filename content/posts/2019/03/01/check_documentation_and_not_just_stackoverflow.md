# Check Documentation And Not Just StackOverflow

There will be times when you look up a problem on stackoverflow for solutions on similar problems. You might come across functions or usage that you might not have encountered or used before. Please make sure to read up the documentation on that new thing. This is because the problem you have and the one explained on StackOverflow might not be exactly the same. Similarly, the way that new function or method is used in that solution might be different from how you should use it in your problem.
